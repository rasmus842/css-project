                    <h2>One of the best!</h2>
                    <p>I used to have rather small biceps before I discovered _NAME_. After several hours of hard work I gained 12 inches of bicep circumference. The women don't care, but at least my gym bros are impressed and I think one is crushing me now!</p>

                    <p>I like big biceps almost as much as I like big boobs. The former on men and the latter on women, of course. I hope one day a workout programme will be written for achieving big boobs aswell. It is simply necessary, ask anyone.</p>
